    <b>What is Welfare?</b>
    <p>Welfare refers to a range of government programs that provide financial
    or other aid to individuals or groups who cannot support themselves. Welfare programs
    are typically funded by taxpayers and allow people to cope with financial stress
    during rough periods of their lives. In most cases, people who use welfare will
    receive a biweekly or monthly payment. The goals of welfare vary, as it looks to
    promote the pursuance of work, education or, in some instances, a better standard of
    living.
    </p>

    <b>How Welfare Works</b>
    <p>Social welfare systems provide assistance to individuals and families through programs
    such as health care, food stamps, unemployment compensation, housing assistance,
    and childcare assistance. In the U.S., a caseworker is assigned to each individual or
    family applying for benefits to determine and confirm the applicant's needs.

    The benefits available to an individual vary by state. Eligibility is determined based
    on factors surrounding the person’s financial status and how it relates to the minimum
    acceptable levels within a particular state. The factors involved can include the size
    of the family unit, current income levels, or an assessed disability.

    Within each state, social welfare systems may go by different names,
    but they often serve similar functions. This can cause confusion when attempting
    to compare one state's program to another. Additionally, the requirements to qualify
    also vary, depending on the poverty line in a particular state. This allows for
    adjustments based on items such as the cost of living that are not standardized across
    the country.
    </p>

    <b>Different Kind of Welfare</b>
    <p>Some popular types of welfare in America include Medicaid,
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),
      and Child’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

      Medicaid is a health insurance program geared towards people with low income and
      the elderly. Pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly who fall below
      a certain income threshold are guaranteed coverage under the Medicaid program.
      Supplemental Security Income is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA)
      and provides public assistance to families in need in the form of cash.
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as the Food Stamp
      Program, is run by each individual state and provides vouchers to low-income households
      to buy nutritious and low-cost foods.
      Child’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is administered by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
      and provides low-cost health care to children in households that won’t otherwise qualify for Medicaid.
    </p>

    <b>Who Qualifies for Welfare?</b>
    <p>Government welfare is primarily aimed towards people with little to no income,
      the elderly, and the disabled. Welfare can be in the form of grants, food stamps,
      vouchers, Medicaid, health care, and housing assistance. The subsidized program
      is only available for legal citizens and permanent residents of the United States.
      Federal law bans states from using grants to assist most legal immigrants unless
      they have resided in the country for five years or more.

      A valid Social Security Number (SSN) is needed to apply for welfare.
      In households with more than one member, all members must have an SSN.
      In addition to meeting the requirements postulated by the federal government,
      individuals applying for welfare must also meet the requirements of their states.
      For example, some states require that the applicant be a resident of that state
      with the intention of continuously living there.

      The desired outcomes of people on welfare will depend primarily on the
      circumstances that caused them to apply for aid. A mentally or physically disabled
      person may not be expected to assume independence after a period of time,
      so a welfare program would provide ongoing aid to better their standard of living.
      A person lacking education, or who cannot currently provide for themselves,
      also might be provided welfare. In this case, the person would be expected to
      receive training or take steps towards financial independence. Ongoing welfare
      is not a desirable outcome for this individual according to those giving it.
